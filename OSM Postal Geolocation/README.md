# OSM Postal Geolocation

This small form uses the [OpenStreetMap Nominatim API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) to retrieve the coordinates of a postal code.

## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.
Every time you change the content of the text box with a new postal code, the results should update automatically. However if it doesn't work, you can use the *Search!* button at the right.

> Your browser must have JavaScript enabled, and Internet connection
