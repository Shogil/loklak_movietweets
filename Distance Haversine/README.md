# Distance Haversine

Calculate the distance between two points on Earth, given by their coordinates, and the sun time difference, through this simple web form.  
The [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) has been used to guess the distance.

## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.  
Every time you change the content of the text boxes with the different coordinates, the results will update automatically.
