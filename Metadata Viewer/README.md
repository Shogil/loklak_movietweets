# Metadata Viewer

This is a simple web form that reads the metadata of entered files. It currently displays:
 - **File name**
 - **Size**
 - **MIME type**
 - **Last modified date**

Makes use of HTML5 file API, and supports multiple input and drag and drop.

## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.
Every time you enter new files (through the `<input>` or drag and drop), the results will update automatically.

> Your browser must have JavaScript enabled
