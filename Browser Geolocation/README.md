# Browser Geolocation

This form uses [HTML5 Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) to gather the user's current position, and the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to show it in a map.  
Styles by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.  
After loading the page, you'll be prompted by your web browser to give the application ubication permissions. After granting them, your coordinates and the map will be automatically loaded.

> Your browser must have JavaScript enabled, and Internet connection
